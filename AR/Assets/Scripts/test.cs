    ///With the use of wheel colliders the car model should be able to drive
    ///The wheels should be able to make a turn and it needs to look realistic
    ///So the parent of the tires should be rotated towards the direction you want to drive
    ///The wheel should roll like its actually driving and not sliding to its destination
    ///Maybe add car sounds for a more realistic experience?
    ///The steering wheel should rotate aswell if you want to turn
    ///Maybe make it possible to click on the doors and it will open/close
    ///The car should not be able to flip. To prevent that from happening there needs to be a speed limit
    ///The car should also be heavy enough to make it unable to flip
    ///The car needs to be able to drive forward and in reverse. The car needs breaks aswell
