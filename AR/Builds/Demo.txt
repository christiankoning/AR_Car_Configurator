AR Demo V1:

Only 2 models(bmw i8, audi a4 allroad)
Only 2-4 rims
Carpaint + rim colors
Rotation + auto rotation
Removing/Replacing model
changing rim colors is working
Shadow under the model(makes it more realistic in world space)

To Add:

Scaling of the object(table scale + full scale? or slider with a min. of table size and max. of full scale)

Model color needs to adept to its surroundings(only available for arkit? can't test if the color gets changed on the iphone)

more realistic materials(use lwrp? shaders(shader graph)?)

change the shadow to use real positions of lights

- Use reflection probes to get reflections in realtime
- Before editing the model. Give the option to change the scale of the object and afterwards make it possible to modify the object
